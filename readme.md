###Resources:

* [Here](http://cgcookie.com/unity/2012/02/20/unity-script-npc-talk-system/) is a good tutorial on how to use Unity for a dialog system. 

###Main

Press left ctrl to see dialogs

Implemented a `line` class and `Speak` function that will: 

1. display corresponding character name and dialog content; 
2. change the character texture to allow for different poses

###To do: 

* typing + sound effect
* change brightness of out-of-focus character
* line should always center in the dialog box
